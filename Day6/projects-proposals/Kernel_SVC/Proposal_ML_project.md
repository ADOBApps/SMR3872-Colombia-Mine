#Optimization and parallelization of the kernel SVC  (support vector classifier)

#Steps to follow

1. Parallelize and optimize the scikit-learn version of the kernel SVC using dask/mpi4py
   
2. Porting of the code to GPU (using pytorch/cupy/numba)

2. Perform a performance analysis of the code scaling, testing datasets with different size/number of features,
different numbers of core, and also different number of GPUs
